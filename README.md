# GPT Tycoon

Welcome to "GPT Tycoon", a browser-based office simulation game where you are the CEO of a tech company, managing a team of digital employees who perform real coding tasks in a dynamic virtual workspace.

You just need to state your vision to your executive assistant and he will help you devise an action plan and delegate tasks to the rest of the company.

## Key Features

- **Digital Employees as Coders**: Each digital employee is a unique entity, represented as a git repository, featuring a workspace branch for coding tasks and a personality branch for individual traits and learned skills or additional information.
